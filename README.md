# Platformer

This project is a basic Pygame that was built as a learning exercise. While the core mechanics like player physics and movement have been implemented using Object-Oriented Programming principles. I have tried to clearly seperate the files and used typehints to improve code readability, the game is far from complete. Feel free extend it!
